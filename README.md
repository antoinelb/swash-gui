# Simulation of breakwaters in wave channel and Baie-des-Bacon

This repo creates a few simulation experiments for breakwaters designed by WSP and refined by interns at INRS.
These simulations are run with [SWASH](https://swash.sourceforge.io/) and a dashboard helps visualise the results as well as modify certain parameters.
The user manual for SWASH is located in `docs/swash_manual.md`.
All SWASH experiments are located in the `experiments` to replicate.
